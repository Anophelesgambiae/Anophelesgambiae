- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Anophelesgambiae
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in birds such as the western jackdaw and great tit. I find mathematical biology very interesting, such as models for epidemiology and in-host modelling.  
- I am at the moment busy with a board game where I draw the cards and board.   
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning applied mathematics (applied area is biology) at university of Utrecht in the Netherlands.
