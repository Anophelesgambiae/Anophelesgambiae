- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Anophelesgambiae
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in birds such as the western jackdaw and great tit. Also on modelling mosquito populations. I find it nice to use math in biology. I draw also. 
- I am at the moment busy with a board game where I draw the cards and board.   
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning on high school.
